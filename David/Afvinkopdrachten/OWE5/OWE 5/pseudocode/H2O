This code draws a H2O molecule at the x and y defined by the user and deletes the old H2O molecule

define a as distance from oxygen to hydrogen
define b as radius of oxygen atom
define c as radius of hydrogen atom
define d as angle between two hydrogen atoms
create frame
    create canvas
    create field for x
    create field for y
    create button for draw

when draw is pressed
    delete old H2O molecule
    draw red circle at x and y specified in canvas
    draw blue circle at x + a and y
    draw blue circle at x + a*cos(d) and y + a*sin(d)
    draw line from x to x + a*cos(d) and y to y + a*sin(d)
    draw line from x + a to x + a*cos(d) and y to y + a*sin(d)
    draw line from x + a to x and y + a to y
