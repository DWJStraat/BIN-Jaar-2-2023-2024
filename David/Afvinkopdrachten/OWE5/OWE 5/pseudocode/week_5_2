This code creates a word prediction code, divided in two parts: the backend and the frontend. It makes use of the
file found at https://downloads.tatoeba.org/exports/sentences.tar.bz2, which contains a list of sentences in many
languages.

Backend:
Set string input as argument
Split string into words
For each word, filter the list of sentences to only those that contain the word
Find the longest common substring between the input and the sentences
Return the sentence

Frontend:
Create screen
    Create text box
    Create label
    Create button
    When button is pressed, call backend
    Display result in label
    Clear text box
