This script asks the user to enter the number of widgets they want to buy and the cost per widget, and then will
calculate the total cost of the widgets.

print("How many widgets do you want to buy?")
set widgets = input
print("How much does each widget cost?")
set cost = input
set total = widgets * cost
print("The total cost of your widgets is " + total)
