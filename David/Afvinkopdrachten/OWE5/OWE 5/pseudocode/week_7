This code reads a sequence and visualizes it

file = null
Create Window
    Create text "file:"
    Create button "open"
    Create entry field "file_name"
    Create text "sequence"
    Create entry field "sequence"
    Create visual canvas "visual"

When "open" is pressed:
    Open file dialog
    If file is pressed:
        Set "file_name" to file name
        If file contents is not a valid sequence:
            Set "sequence" to "ERROR, file not a valid sequence"
        Else:
            Set "sequence" to file contents
            Draw sequence on "visual"
    Else:
        Set "file_name" to ""
        Set "sequence" to "ERROR, file not found"
