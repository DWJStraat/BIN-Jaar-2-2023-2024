    code that will generate a syntax error is:
        print "test"

    Semantics is the meaning of the code. An example of a piece of python code that will generate a semantic is:
        int('test')

2.  The computer stores the program in the memory in the form of the variable. This way, it can be accessed easily
    by other texts.

3. A type in programming is a way of classifying data.

7. Operator precedence is the order in which operators are recognized, similarly to the order in which mathematical

12. Int, Double, and Bool types are primitive types, and thus handled on a more simple level. String is not a primitive
    type, and thus is handled on a more complex level.

13. An import directive is used to direct Java to read another piece of code that is not in the current file and store
    the classes as objects in the memory.
